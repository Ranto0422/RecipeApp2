## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ranto0422/RecipeApp2.git
```

### 2. PHP Backend Setup

1. Copy the files from `php Files for login and register/` (login.php, register.php) into your XAMPP `htdocs` directory:
   ```
   C:/xampp/htdocs/myrecipeapp/
   ```
2. Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel.
3. Open phpMyAdmin and create a new database:
   - Name: `myrecipeapp`

4. Create the `users` table by running this SQL in phpMyAdmin:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       role ENUM('admin', 'user') DEFAULT 'user'
   );
   ```

5. (Optional) To create an admin account, insert a user with role 'admin':
   - start the app and register a new user with the name "Admin" and email "admin" then go to phpMyAdmin and manually change the role to 'admin' for that user.

6. Make sure your Android app's API URLs point to your local XAMPP server (e.g., `http://10.0.2.2/myrecipeapp/login.php`).

## ‚ú® Additional Notes

- For full functionality, ensure your backend is running and accessible from your Android emulator/device.
- You may need to adjust firewall or network settings for emulator-to-XAMPP communication.
